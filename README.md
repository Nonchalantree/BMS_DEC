# BMS_DEC

About
-----

This program decodes BMS files from several Nintendo games, and converts them to MIDI.

Games that use BMS include (probably not a comprehensive list):

  * Super Mario Sunshine (not supported yet)
  * Luigi's Mansion (supported, BMS_DEC)
  * Pikmin 1 (supported, BMS_DEC)
  * Zelda Wind Waker (untested)
  * Pikmin 2 (untested)
  * Zelda Twilight Princess (untested)
  * Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (supported, BMS_DE~1)

How to use
 For Windows:
 Open cmd.exe (ctrl R, type "cmd" in the box)
 Drag the executable to the window, DO NOT PRESS ENTER. Press space.
 To insert the first argument, drag the BMS file to the window. Press space.
 To insert the second argument, drag the BMS file again, and add a .mid extension to the name.
 Now press enter, and wait. If it takes a super long time, it crashed. It should only take a second or so at most.
 BMS_DEC is recommended for Luigi's Mansion, Super Mario Sunshine, and Pikmin 1.
 BMS_DE~1 is recommended for Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Mario Kart Double Dash, and Super Mario Galaxy 1/2.
 Other games have not been tested, but may work.
 
Have fun!
